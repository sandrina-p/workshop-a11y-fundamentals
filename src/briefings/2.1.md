# Interactive elements

## Introduction

Many users, especially people with motor disabilities or visual disabilities, rely on a keyboard to navigate the web. These people need **visual focus indicators** to enjoy the web.

It's common to hide the default focus indicator [because it's ugly](../assets/imgs/browser-focus.png) and [it's different across browsers](https://allyjs.io/tests/focus-outline-styles/#style=focus&key=text,radio,checkbox,textarea,button,link,div&browser=firefox,chrome,safari,ie11. That's okay though. What's not okay is to not build an alternative. **We must provide accessible focus states on our apps.**

```css
button:focus {
  /* It's okay to do this... */
  outline: none;

  /* ...if we build a custom indicator */
  box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px tomato;
}
```

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/2.1.html),
there are 4 interactive elements. However, we can't easily access them through the keyboard.

**🎯 Goal:** Make all interactive elements accessible by keyboard with `:hover` and `:focus`.

**Tip:** You can use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to go forwards and backwards respectively across the interactive elements.

There aren't any explicit design requirements, so you can go _free-style_!
Adding some opacity or changing the color are common design approaches.

**Safari Note:** By default `Tab` doesn't work on links and buttons. Activate those in _Settings > Advanced > [✓] Press tab to highlight each item on a web page_.

## Bonus

### #1 Focus only when using the keyboard

Another reason to hide the focus indicator on buttons and links is because the focus is triggered when clicking them.

We can ignore the focus when using the mouse and show it only when using the keyboard, using [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) comes in!

Most browsers do not support it yet, so we need the polyfill [focus-visible.js](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible)

```html
<!-- Include the polyfill at the bottom of the page -->
<script src="../assets/polyfill-focus-visible.js"></script>
```

```css
/* hide the focus indicator always */
.js-focus-visible button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* show the focus only with keyboard */
.js-focus-visible button:focus.focus-visible {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0.3rem 0.3rem tomato;
}
```

**🎯 Goal:** Add `focus-visible` to the buttons and links.

### #2 Custom select

A custom accessible select is one of the trickiest things to create. Short answer: **Avoid them if you can**.

But let’s face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.

There's a relative simple technique enhance these custom selects. I called this a _"hybrid select"_. It consists of 2 selects:

- A native select, visible and accessible by default
- A custom select, hidden until it’s safe to be interacted with a mouse

The trick is to show each one at the right moment:

```css
.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}

/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**🎯 Goal:** Create a simple "hybrid select".

**Important:** This select still has A11Y issues. This is a "partial solution" of a bigger ["hybrid select"](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/) experiment. If you use this in the future, please build the full implementation.
