<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important aspects of web accessibility. Many users, especially people with motor disabilities and blind people rely on a keyboard to navigate through the web. These people need an <strong>accessible focus indicators</strong> to enjoy the web.</p>
<p>A very common practice is to hide the default focus indicator <a href="../assets/imgs/browser-focus.png">because it's ugly</a> and <a href="https://allyjs.io/tests/focus-outline-styles/#style=focus&key=text,radio,checkbox,textarea,button,link,div&browser=firefox,chrome,safari,ie11">different across browsers</a>. And that's okay. The mistake is to not provide a proper focus state. <strong>We must include accessible focus states on our design.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">button:focus {
  /* It's okay to do this... */
  outline: none;

  /* ...if we build a custom indicator */
  box-shadow: 0 0 0.3rem 0.3rem tomato;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/2.1.html">exercise page</a>,
there are a bunch of interactive elements: links, buttons and form controls. However, we can't easily access them through keyboard.</p>
<p>There isn't any explicit design requirements, so you can go free style!
Adding some opacity or change the color are common design approaches.
Creating both <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus</code> states is the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>🎯 Goal:</strong> Make all interactive elements accessible by keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<h3 id="1custominteractiveelements">#1 Custom interactive elements</h3>
<p>Creating a custom accessible element sometimes is a (very) hard challenge.
Go try to select "Your role" using only the keyboard and then come back here.</p>
<p>That was an impossible mission, right? There's a trick to avoid the
complex task of re-creating an a11y <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and it involves CSS!</p>
<p>The trick is to create 2 selects and show them on the right moment.
A custom one visible by default for "mouse based" users and a native one hidden until it's focused by keyboard.</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* visually hide selectNative  */
.selectNative {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* show it on focus  */
.selectNative:focus {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* hide selectCustom on selectNative:focus  */
.selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>🎯 Goal:</strong> Create a simpler <code>select</code> accessible version</p>
<p>This technique is what it's called <em>graceful degradation technique</em>.
Add a fallback version when the ideal does not work. This experience is not as good, but it does deliver the essential functionality for everyone. <strong>Things won't break for anyone</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2focusonlywhenusingkeyboard">#2 Focus only when using keyboard</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons to hide the focus indicator on buttons and links is because it's triggered when we click them.
What if we could activate <code>:focus</code> only when using the keyboard and ignore it when using the mouse?
That's where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible"><code>:focus-visible</code></a> comes in!</p>
<p>Most browsers do not support it yet, but there is a tiny polyfill: <a href="https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible">focus-visible.js</a></p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;!-- Include the polyfill at the bottom of the page --&gt;
&lt;script src="../assets/polyfill-focus-visible.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* hide the focus indicator always */
.js-focus-visible button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* show the focus only with keyboard */
.js-focus-visible button:focus.focus-visible {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0.3rem 0.3rem tomato;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>🎯 Goal:</strong> Add <code>focus-visible</code> and update buttons and anchor <code>:focus</code> styles to use it.</p>
