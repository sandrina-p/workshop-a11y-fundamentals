# 4.1. Loading states

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but there are some patterns that aren't that straightforward:

In A11Y, some patterns may have multiple solutions. Each approach has positive and negative consequences. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions and balance them. We should **aim for understanding the impacts and assume the trade-offs** rather than pretending they don't exist.

---

One of those patterns are [loading skeletons](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a), which are used to show that the page or some part of it is being loaded.

These are perceivable visually but the same ain't true for the people with vision impairment, or those who use a screen reader.

ARIA Live Regions fill this gap helping to expose this dynamic content. There are two types:

- `aria-live="assertive"` or `role="alert"`: The content is announced immediately when added to the DOM.

```html
<p aria-live="assertive">The credentials are incorrect.</p>
```

- `aria-live="polite"` or `role="status"`: The content is announced when there's nothing else to be announced. Use it when this does not influence the user main task.

```html
<p aria-live="polite">Playing now: "Pink Floyd - Time"</p>
```

Here's a [codepen example](https://codepen.io/vloux/details/jxPrWy) exploring multiple ways of using `aria-live`. In this exercise, the code is ready to follow the approach #3 mentioned in the codepen.

## Exercise

In the exercise page,
there is a dummy search mechanism that loads a set of results.

Visually, it's perceivable when the result is being loaded and when it's finished. But what about people using screen readers. How can we do it?

**üéØ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of the loading state for people with visual impairments.

- Standard: [exercise](../exercises/4.1.html) and [solution](../solutions/4.1.html)
- React: [exercise](../exercises/4.1.react.html) and [solution](../solutions/4.1.react.html)

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #1:</summary>

The designs don't include a visual message when the loading is finished...
Remember `.sr-only`? It's the perfect time to use it!

</details>

## Bonus #1

Using the cursor, you may have noticed that a tooltip is shown on button hover. Now, try to do the same using the keyboard only.

That's not possilbe because the button is disabled using `disabled` attribute. How can we solve this? Prevent the click interaction, but still allowing the focus interaction.

P.S. The CSS is the same for both exercise alternatives.

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #1:</summary>
There is an attribute `aria-disabled="true"` that we can use.

Semantically it marks the button as disabled, but it does not change the behavior. In other words, you can still focus it using the keyboard.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #2:</summary>
ARIA only purpose is to add extra semantics to an element. It never, _ever_ changes the styles or behavior of that element.

That means, you need to manually prevent the click and change the CSS styles when that attribute is presented.

## Exercise takeaways

<details>
<summary>(After the exercise) Reveal takeaways</summary>

- Use live regions to announce dynamic content, such as loading states and feedback messages.
- Be mindful of the number of live regions. Announcing too many live messages will be annoying.
- Write short messages in the live regions. Do no add `aria-live` around interactive elements or list of elements, as it does more harm than good.
- `aria-live` does not work if added to an existing DOM element. (see [example 2](https://codepen.io/vloux/details/jxPrWy)).
- You know what's better than a disabled button? Not disabling buttons at all.
- As a designer, always provide the name of each loading state. #invisibleCopy
