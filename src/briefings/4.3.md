# 4.3. Components collection

## Introduction

So far, you've learned that creating accessible websites isn't as hard as it sounds. Most of the UI can be fully accessible through native HTML elements and a couple of `ARIA` attributes.

The modern web experiences have been evolving way faster than the languages available (HTML). We don't have yet a `<tooltip>`, `<modal>` or `<tabs>` native elements, so we need to find our way around with the existing tools. I'll be truly honest with you: **building custom components fully accessible is harder than it looks like.**

Because of that, when I need to implement a new component that doesn't exist as an `HTML` element, I use **existing components from the community** instead of reinventing the wheel and risking creating a non-accessible experience.

I recommend you to do the same. Here's a personal accurated list of common UI patterns:

## Libraries

- [Accessible components](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_components) - Plain HTML / JS, no library required.
- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) - A headless accessible foundation of your React-based design system.
- [React ARIA](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) - A library of React hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for your design system.
- [Awesome Vue.JS A1YY](https://github.com/vue-a11y/awesome-a11y-vue) - List of things related to A11Y in Vue.js.

## Solo Components

Before you use an "accessible package" from the community, don't get sold by ["self-claimed" accessible components
](https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-04-02-accessible-front-end-components-claims-vs-reality). Do your own research and aim to know their reality before you include their code in your codebase.
