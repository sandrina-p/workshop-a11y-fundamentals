# 2.2. Hidden elements

## Introduction

Nowadays, a lot of content is hidden on a page until it's necessary: menus, drawers, dialogs, tooltips... you name it!

When we hide content visually, we must remember to hide it completely. Otherwise, those elements are still accessible, even when invisible.

This mistake can confuse and frustrate those who lose track of the focus indicator while navigating the page.

These are common ways to hide content:

```css
/* Visually hidden but accessible by keyboard */
opacity: 0;

/* Completely hidden: visually and by keyboard */
display: none;
visibility: hidden;
```

We can also hide part of the DOM completely, with the attribute `inert`. This will tell the browser to "ignore" the elements inside as if they didn't exist.

```html
<!-- Even invisible, "Get started" can be clicked / focused -->
<div style="opacity: 0">
  <button>Get started</button>
</div>
```

```html
<!-- With `inert`, we cannot interact with "Add to cart" -->
<div style="opacity: 0" inert="true">
  <button>Get started</button>
</div>
```

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/2.2.html),
there's a sidebar that can be toggled through a `<button>`. Use your keyboard to navigate through the page. You'll notice the links inside the sidebar are still accessible even if the menu is hidden.

**🎯 Goal:** Make the interactive elements only accessible when visible.

**Hint 1:** Use Accessibility Insights "Tab Stops" feature to detect errors within interactive elements.

**Hint 2:** The attribute `inert` lacks browser support, so we need the [inert polifyll](https://github.com/WICG/inert).

```html
<!-- Include the inert polyfill at the bottom of the page -->
<script src="../assets/polyfill-inert.js"></script>
```
