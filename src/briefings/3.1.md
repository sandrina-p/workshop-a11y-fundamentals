# 3.1. Meaningful content

## Introduction

Every content needs to provide 3 pieces of information:

- **Role** - The type of element. E.g a button, a heading or a list.
- **Name** - The text to identify / describe the element.
- **State** - Applicable in dynamic elements. E.g. A button is pressed or a menu is opened.

For sighted people, the page visual appearance can be enough to understand an element's purpose. However, the same might not happen to people relying on AT (Assistive Technologies) Screen Readers.

Most of the time, _role_ and _name_ are automatically included through semantic HTML. Let's see an example where that's not true:

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<button>X</button>
<!-- Announced: "X, button" -->
```

In this case the element name does not make sense semantically. That's where ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes come in. **ARIA allows us to enhance the HTML semantics of an element.**

A common [naming technique](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#names_and_descriptions) is to add the attribute `aria-label`.

```html
<!-- Good -->
<button aria-label="Close dialog">X</button>
<!-- Announced: "Close dialog, button" -->
```

Some automated translation tools will miss `aria-label`. A safer solution is to add a visually hidden element and hide the visual element.

```html
<!-- Better -->
<button>
  <span class="sr-only">Close dialog</span>
  <span aria-hidden="true">X</span>
</button>
<!-- Announced: "Close dialog, button". -->
<!-- In portuguese: "Fechar dialogo, botão" -->
```

Note that **ARIA never modifies an element styling or behavior**. Check the next example:

```html
<!-- This isn't enough! -->
<span role="button"> Get started </span>
```

This "visual button" is still not focusable and doesn't have keyboard event listeners. (Enter and Space keys). Whenever possible, prefer to use the native HTML elements and use ARIA only has an enhancement.

There are [more than 45 `aria-*` attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_def). Today we'll explore some of the most common.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.1.html),
there are multiple cases where some pieces of information were forgotten or misused. Some `aria-*` attributes and `.sr-only` class will be your friends here.

**🎯 Goal:** Add accessible names or status to all elements.

**Hint:** Use the Accessibility tab on DevTools to verify if the accessible name is working. It can be an alternative to screen readers.

## Exercise takeaways

<details>
<summary>(After the exercise) Reveal takeaways</summary>

- Use `ARIA` as last resource. Prefer HTML elements whenever possible.
- When creating an element, always ask yourself "Is its name, role and state accessibles?"
- Use a Screen Reader when testing new user interfaces.
- Ensure the content is meaningful when accessed without colors, styles, or images.
