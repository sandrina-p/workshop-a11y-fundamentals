# 3.1. Meaningful content

## Introduction

Every content has to provide three essential pieces of information to explain its purpose:

- **Role** - The type of element. E.g a button, a heading or a list.
- **Name** - The text to identify / describe the element.
- **State** - Needed in dynamic elements - E.g, if a button is pressed or a menu opened.

For sighted users, the page context and visual appearance can be enough to understand an element's purpose. However, the same doesn't apply to people relying on assistive technologies.

Most of the time, _role_ and _name_ are automatically included through semantic HTML. However, when that's not enough. That's where ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes come in.

It's our responsibility to providing elements with accessible names. A common [naming technique](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#names_and_descriptions) is to add the attribute `aria-label`.

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<button>X</button>

<!-- Good -->
<button aria-label="Close modal">X</button>
```

There's a downside with this approach thought. Some`aria-label`. Some automated translation tools will miss `aria-label`. A safer solution is to add a visually hidden element.

```html
<!-- Better -->
<button>
  <span class="sr-only">Close modal</span>
  X
</button>
```

There are [more than 45 `aria-*` attributes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/states_and_properties). Today we'll start by exploring the most common.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.1.html),
there are 5 cases where some pieces of information were forgotten or missused. Some `aria-*` attributes and `.sr-only` class will be your friends here.

**🎯 Goal:** Add accessible names or status to all elements.

**Hint:** Use the Accessibility tab on DevTools to verify if the accessible name is working. It can be an alternative to screen readers.
