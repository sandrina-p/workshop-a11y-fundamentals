# Web Accessibility Fundamentals

_The web is awesome and everyone should be able to enjoy it._

---

Hi there! I'm [Sandrina Pereira](https://twitter.com/a_sandrina_p) and I believe that making the web accessible is one of our duties as web creators.

These are the material resources for my [Web Accessibility Fundamentals workshop](https://www.sandrina-p.net/workshop-a11y/).

## Pre-Workshop requirements

To get the most out of the workshop, please do the following things in advance:

- **Install the needed video tool** to join the video call.
  - Turn on your video if possible, so we don't feel alone.
  - Keep your microphone muted to avoid background noises.
- **The browser Chrome or Firefox installed.**. We'll use Chrome most of the time.
- **Setup the project** prior to the workshop to avoid unexpected installation issues.
- **Install the browser extensions** that we will use during the workshop.
- **Familiarize yourself with the basics of a screen reader**. During a remote workshop it's not practical to help everyone using a SR (screen reader). For that reason, please take some minutes to practice in advance.
  - Mac: You'll be using VoiceOver. [Watch this VO introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&t=198s).
  - Windows: Install [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [watch this NVDA introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU).
  - Linux: Install [Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) and [watch this Orca introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OWSztc3AtY).
  - SR keyboard shortcuts: [VO and NVDA](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/survival-guide) and [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/commands_controlling_orca.html.en).

The better prepared you are for the workshop, the more you will learn from it!

## Setup the workshop

### Recommended

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) before proceding. Otherwise jump to the next _Alternatives_ section.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandrina-p/workshop-a11y-fundamentals.git

# Go to workshop folder
cd workshop-a11y-fundamentals

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run the project
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) and double-check the page loads correctly.

### Alternatives

#### Locally

- [Download the project](https://github.com/sandrina-p/workshop-a11y-fundamentals/archive/main.zip) and open `src/index.html`. You are ready to go.

## Developer extensions

During the workshop, we will explore the following extensions.
Kindly install them ahead of time so that you can use them right away during the workshop.

- [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/downloads/) - Chrome only
- [Axe Developer Tools](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) - Chrome or Firefox

### Optional

I'll briefly mention the extensions below at some point in the workshop.

- [Colour contract checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) - Chrome only
- [Web Developer](https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) - Chrome or Firefox
- [headingsMap](https://www.learningapps.co.uk/moodle/xertetoolkits/play.php?template_id=1309#page1section3) - Chrome or Firefox

## Workshop Dynamic

### Project structure

The workshop consists of a set of challenges.  
Each one introduces a new topic, followed by a code exercise for you to apply the concepts learned.
After each challenge, we'll go through the solution together and clarify any questions that you might have.

```bash
src/
  briefings/  # The exercises introduction
    *.md
  exercises/  # Where you'll be coding
    *.html      # The exercise html
    *.css       # The exercise styles
  solutions/  # The solutions
  index.html  # Workshop entry point
```

**Notes:**

- **Check solutions as a last resource.** If you take a peek at the solution before even trying, you'll be sabotaging your own learning. It's okay to struggle while you solve the exercise. It's part of the learning process. :)
- **Time expectations:** I don't expect you to complete the entire exercise on time. The goal is to introduce you to new things, to make you think about them, and ask me questions as we go through the materials.
- **Guidance & tips:** In the code, you'll find the _light bulb_ emoji üí° to guide you, and the _lucky clover_ emoji üçÄ with extra tips.
